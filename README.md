# javascript_training
I start to learn again js from beginning to be more better

I started another journey on the path of programming, already having knowledge of JS I decided to delve deeper into the subject
I started a course from basic to professional on js
where basic knowledge about js is covered

See my projects, see my journey, see my commits and see how I evolve over time

I'm writing this on my first day
But I'm sure that by the time you're reading this I'll already be a JS master and I'll be mastering React

It was a pleasure
